## The 3Cs of Storytelling
1. Context
1. Challenge
1. Conclusion

#### Stories should be Clear, Compelling, and Accurate.

You have to cut out story clutter just as you would chart clutter and clearly define the who, what, and why of your story. You also must keep your audience central to the planning of your story and presentation.

## Pre-Planning

### Design a Checklist of Who, What, Why, and How

- What key elements will drive your data story?
    - What's the purpose of creating your story?
    - What is the current situation? (Context)
    - What is the conflict being faced? (Challenge)
    - What is the payoff for solving the conflict? (Conclusion)
- Who includes interested parties.
    - Who is your audience?
    - Who are stakeholders?
    - Who are SMEs?
    - What data is available?
- Why includes goals and objectives.
- How includes the format and point of view.
    - Will you be presenting static slides, paper report, or an interactive dashboard?
- You might start with story points to build and organize your story in Tableau.
- You will need to refine and optimize as you build.
    - This will mean adding and removing story elements, visuals, etc.

### Expressiveness and Effectiveness

- Do you have data to express your story accurately?
- Does presentation style effectively convey data's meaning?

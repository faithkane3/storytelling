# Data Storytelling Notes from Coursera Course

> "Data tell you what's happening; stories tell you why it matters."

## The 3Cs of Storytelling
1. Context
1. Challenge
1. Conclusion

#### Stories should be Clear, Compelling, and Accurate.

You have to cut out story clutter just as you would chart clutter and clearly define the who, what, and why of your story. You also must keep your audience central to the planning of your story and presentation.

## Pre-Planning - Stakeholders Goals & User Needs

### Design a Checklist of Who, What, Why, and How

- What key elements will drive your data story?
    - What's the purpose of creating your story?
    - What is the current situation? (Context)
    - What is the conflict being faced? (Challenge)
    - What is the payoff for solving the conflict? (Conclusion)
- Who includes interested parties.
    - Who is your audience?
    - Who are stakeholders?
    - Who are SMEs?
    - What data is available?
- Why includes goals and objectives.
- How includes the format and point of view.
    - Will you be presenting static slides, paper report, or an interactive dashboard?
- You might start with story points to build and organize your story in Tableau.
- You will need to refine and optimize as you build.
    - This will mean adding and removing story elements, visuals, etc.

### Expressiveness and Effectiveness

- Do you have data to express your story accurately?
- Does presentation style effectively convey data's meaning?

### Starting with Your Stakeholders

- They can help you refine drivers for the viz.
- Provide key requirements and purpose.
- Provide details about data available.
- Identify and clarify audience characteristics.
- Inventory stakeholder requirements, source materials, and goals.
- Assess your level of domain knowledge and understanding of the business case.

#### Questions to Ask Stakeholders

- Which elements, details, and results must be included in the story?
- What the timeline for the project/presentation?
- Summary of story points and goal for data story.
- Benchmarks or metrics to measure success.

### Know Your Audience

- Level of Understanding
- Reasons for Viewing
- Intended takeaways
- Types of visualizations and level of statistical or technical sophistication
- Different segements of audience that will be attending/viewing presentation

#### Create Personas

- Creating personas that represent segments of your audience helps you prioritize design requirements
    - Quantitative: Surveys to capture common patterns of audience segments
    - Qualitative: Changing your perspective
    
#### Early Interview Guidance

- List of needs and goals
- Interview a target audience segment
- Ask open-ended questions, not showing a prototype and asking what they like about it. Ask about needs, goals, pain points, level of understanding.
- Don't ask narrow and highly specific questions at the beginning.
- Focus on essential needs but be open to a new solution and design specific solutions.
- Ask right questions about goals and audience background.
- The solutions are your job as the designer.
- In what contexts or platform with the view the data story?

#### Later Interview Guidance

- At this point, it's ok to show a few design ideas. Avoid a single choice.
- Take into account your audience context, how much detail should you show, how much interaction will there be with presenter and viz, how long should the story be, etc.

#### Design to How the Human Brain Works

- People are good at finding stories in patterns even when the story is not really there. (Beward of False narratives, both created by you and created by audience from viewing your visualizations)
- Humans tend to see and amplify what they expect to find. (Confirmation Bias)
- Be aware of other types of bias, as well.
- Make sure data provides a complete picture to avoid audience drawing their own conclusions based on misunderstandings.

## Finding the Story - Getting Into the Data

- Questions about data:
    - What types of data do I have to work with?
    - What's the data quality and completeness?
    - What are the most relelvant dimensions of the data?
    - How fresh and frequently updated is the data?
    - How will the data be framed?
    - What type of actions and decisions might my story prompt?
    
- Not all patterns in the data make true stories. More data, more risk of false narratives and the temptation to turn insufficient data into false narratives.
- Where is the most useful data to be found? (Survivor Bias) Help the audience recognize and reframe the full data story using context and key points.
- Weight and evaulate available data and work to fill in the gaps.
- Relevance of data may shift with context and/or new data. (Context)
- All the necessary data may not be available at the start of a project.
- Seemingly irrelevant data may turn out to be essential to the story.
- Test data against various factors and other data and from various perspectives.
- To clarify thinking, try seeing from different perspectives.

## Aligning, Prioritizing, Optimizing, and Designing the Data Story

- Does the data provide the level of detail to meet the stakeholders' needs?
- Is your aim to persuade of to draw conclusions?
- Is your purpose to start an open-ended conversation?
- Prepare to pivot if the data surprises you or contradicts your initial hypotheses.
- Will your presentation/report explore or explain?
- Balance meeting needs of stakeholders as well as connecting with your audience needs.
- What level of detail will be most effective for your data story? This really depends on the eyes of the beholders.
- "Everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler." You have to provide what the audience needs, not more, not less.
- The story arc you choose should depend on your audience and context.
